                        on the basis of Articles 16, 17 (1), 18 DSGVO. However, this obligation does not exist insofar
                        as this notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding the

                    <p>Your data processed during the use of our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the
                        purpose of the storage no longer applies, the deletion of the data does not conflict with any

                    <p>For technical reasons, in particular to ensure a secure and stable Internet presence, data is
                        transmitted by your Internet browser to us or to our web space provider. These so-called server
                        log files are used to collect, among other things, the type and version of your Internet browser,
                        the operating system, the website from which you accessed our website (referrer URL),
                        the website(s) of our website that you visit, the date and time of the respective access as well
                        as the IP address of the Internet connection from which the use of our website takes place.</p>
                    <p>The data collected in this way is stored temporarily, but not together with other data about you.</p>
                    <p>This storage takes place on the legal basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest
                        lies in the improvement, stability, functionality and security of our website.</p>
                    <p>The data is deleted again after seven days at the latest, unless further storage is required for
                        evidence purposes. Otherwise, the data is exempt from deletion in whole or in part until final
                        clarification of an incident.</p>

                        <p>We use so-called cookies with our Internet presence. Cookies are small text files or other
                            storage technologies that are placed and stored on your terminal device by the Internet
                            browser you use. Through these cookies, certain information from you, such as your browser
                            or location data or your IP address, is processed to an individual extent.  </p>
                        <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, effective and secure, as the processing
                            enables, for example, the reproduction of our website in different languages or the offer of
                            a shopping cart function.</p>
                        <p>The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b.) DSGVO, insofar as these cookies
                            data are processed for contract initiation or contract execution.</p>
                        <p>If the processing does not serve the purpose of initiating or executing a contract, our
                            legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website. In this case, the
                            legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.</p>
                        <p>When you close your internet browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
                        <li>Third-party cookies</li>

                        <p>You can prevent or restrict the installation of cookies by setting your internet browser.
                            Likewise, you can delete already stored cookies at any time. However, the steps and measures
                            required for this depend on your specific Internet browser used. If you have any questions,
                            please use the help function or documentation of your Internet browser or contact its
                            manufacturer or support. In the case of so-called Flash cookies, however, processing cannot be
                            prevented via the browser settings. Instead, you must change the settings of your Flash player.
                            The steps and measures required for this also depend on the specific Flash player you use. If
                            you have any questions, please also use the help function or documentation of your Flash player
                            or contact the manufacturer or user support.</p>
                        <p>However, if you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, this may mean that not all
                            functions of our website can be fully used.</p>

                    <h4>Customer account / registration function</h4>
                    <p>If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will collect and store the data you
                        enter during registration (e.g. your name, address or e-mail address) exclusively for pre-contractual
                        services, for the fulfillment of the contract or for the purpose of customer care (e.g. to provide
                        you with an overview of your previous orders with us or to be able to offer you the so-called memo
                        function). At the same time we store the IP address and the date of your registration together with
                        the time. Of course, this data will not be passed on to third parties.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the further registration process, your consent to this processing will be obtained
                        and reference will be made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us in this process will be
                        used exclusively for the provision of the customer account.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as you consent to this processing, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DSGVO is the legal basis for the
                        processing.</p>
                    <p>If the opening of the customer account also serves pre-contractual measures or the fulfillment of
                        the contract, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO.</p>
                    <p>The consent given to us for the opening and maintenance of the customer account can be revoked at
                        any time with effect for the future in accordance with Art. 7 (3) DSGVO. For this purpose, you only
                        need to inform us of your revocation.</p>
                    <p>The data collected in this respect will be deleted as soon as the processing is no longer necessary.
                        In doing so, however, we must observe retention periods under tax and commercial law.</p>
