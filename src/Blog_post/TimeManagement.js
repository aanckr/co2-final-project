                    <p>Student life is often filled with a busy schedule, many tasks, and numerous commitments.
                        Effective time management is, therefore, crucial to minimize stress and get the most out
                        of your studies. Here are some proven strategies that can help you better organize your
                        time and reduce stress:</p>
                    <p><strong>The Pomodoro Technique</strong> involves working in set intervals (usually 25 minutes) followed
                        by short breaks. Not only does this help you maintain focus, but it also allows you to
                        take regular breaks and recover.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Eisenhower Principle:</strong> Divide your tasks into four categories: important and urgent,
                        important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither important nor urgent.
                        Prioritize your tasks accordingly and work on the ones that are important first.</p>
                    <p><strong>To-Do Lists:</strong> Keep a list of tasks you want to accomplish and update it regularly. Checking
                        off completed tasks gives you a sense of accomplishment and helps you stay on track.</p>
                    <p><strong>Planning breaks:</strong> schedule regular breaks into your schedule. These short time-outs can help
                        you recharge your batteries and maintain your focus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid multitasking:</strong> focus on one task at a time to work more efficiently and reduce stress.</p>
