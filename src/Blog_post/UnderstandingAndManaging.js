                    <p>Stress is an ever-present companion in every student's life. The demands of studying,
                        exam pressure, and personal obligations can cause stress to accumulate and negatively
                        impact mental and physical health. But stress doesn't always have to be negative. A
                        certain amount of stress can motivate you and boost your performance. The key is to
                        learn healthy coping strategies.</p>
                    <p>To successfully manage stress, it's essential to recognize it early. Watch for signs
                        such as trouble sleeping, irritability, concentration, and physical symptoms such as
                        headaches. A proven approach to stress management is to learn relaxation techniques
                        such as breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga. These techniques can help you calm
                        down, balance your nervous system, and promote a positive mindset.</p>
                    <p>In addition to relaxation, time management is key to reducing stress. Plan your tasks
                        ahead of time, set realistic goals, and use effective time management methods like the
                        Pomodoro Technique to work more productively and take regular breaks. Remember that it's
                        essential to have realistic expectations of yourself and to ask for help occasionally,
                        whether from fellow students or faculty.</p>
                    <p><em>Overall, stress management is an ongoing process. By focusing on your physical and mental
                        health, learning relaxation techniques, and optimizing your time management, you can
                        effectively manage study stress and enjoy a balanced study experience.</em></p>
